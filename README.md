# Defeat_the_Demonlord
***The following repository contains the source code for the game Defeat the Demonlord (placeholdername), a game that is the endproduct for from the course TDDD23 Game Design.***

## Current Bugs:
* Healthbar doesn't act like it should. (Works for now...)

## Issues (not really bugs, more structural issues):
* Changing `healthbar` color is not memory-efficient at all since it dublicates per character.
* Should not pass through enemy units.
* Drawpath should stay to show where character started.

## Annoying features:
* Character located below another character should appear on top of the other character. (change node order)
* Cannot deselect enemies by clicking on map.
* Turn-mangager doesn't pause after victory/lost
